# Todo-App

Todo app helps to keep tracking of day to day activities. Application allows to create a new task, edit task, delete task and filter tasks either by specific date or task status. Search bar is added in all pages which helps to search the tasks from the current window. Bottom navigation guides the user to move across different tabs. UI part is implemented using Flutter. API's have been implemented using spring boot rest API. All the API's have been exposed and Flutter is consuming the API in order to render the data in UI part.

**Tech Stacks :**

Springboot for API, Flutter for UI and Postgres for storing data.
